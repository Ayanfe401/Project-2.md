## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Omega Manufacturingâ€™s Order Processing System

## Overview

This document outlines the Dataverse schema for the Order Processing System at Omega Manufacturing. The schema defines the core tables (entities), their key fields with data types, and the relationships between them. The design is created to centralize order processing and inventory management into one secure, structured, and scalable database. This integration will support automation, reduce manual errors, and provide realâ€‘time insights, thereby addressing the challenges Omega Manufacturing currently faces.

Omega Manufacturing experiences delays, errors, and a lack of realâ€‘time visibility due to using multiple tools such as spreadsheets and email for order processing. With this well-structured ERD, information flows seamlessly between departments and supports efficient workflows and data accuracy.

## 2. Relationships Between Tables

Understanding how these entities are connected is essential for a unified data structure:

| **Relationship**                             | **Description**                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer â†” Customer Order                      | One customer can have many orders. The Customer Order table uses CustomerID to link each order to its customer. |
| Customer Order â†” Order Item                    | One order can contain multiple items. Each Order Item is linked to a particular order using OrderID.  |
| Product â†” Order Item                           | A product can appear in many order items. The Order Item table uses ProductID to reference the corresponding product. |
| Product â†” Inventory                            | Each product has one corresponding inventory record. The ProductID matches in both tables to ensure accurate stock information. |
